# Scope 

Build a ProductReview app

# Description

This will be a Product-Review app, where customers `who wish to buy` / `who have bought` a product can `read` / `write` reviews about the product. 

# Purpose

 The purpose of this app is to `read` / `write` non-biased review `on` / `for` the product `under` / `after` purchase.
  - Reviews on Amazon/Ebay etc. have a mix of product & seller reviews fused, which is misleading for customers.
  - Reviews on Amazon/Ebay etc. are at times fakes from the seller of the product.
  - Need a platform similar to IMDB for general consumer products.
